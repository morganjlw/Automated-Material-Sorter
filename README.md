# Automated-Material-Sorter
Automated material sorting of steel, iron, white, and black objects.

## Summary
This repsitory outlines the design and implementation process of creating the MECH 458 Automated Material Sorting lab project. As a result of this lab project, a fully functional material sorting system was realized. The system is controlled by a 8-bit AVR based microcontroller and comprises of a conveyor belt with an array of sensors that is driven by a brushed DC motor to feed a sorting tray that is mechanically coupled to a DC stepper motor for control. The system design was successful and bears testament to the robust design approach and implementation. The system benchmarked remarkably well, despite a lack of additional features that could have improved performance. Possible improvements include increased conveyor belt speed and sorting "hazard" management.
